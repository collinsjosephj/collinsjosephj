- 👋 Hi, I prefer Jessy. I was a big fan of Free Willy as a kid. 
- 👀 I’m interested in travel. Mostly. But I also enjoy meandering the beautiful PNW with my beloved husky, Statia. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the MERN stack.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything and everything. 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I was born in Makati, Manila, and I have lived in Hawaii, Oregon, and the Philippines.
- Mahalo!
