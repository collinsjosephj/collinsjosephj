- 👋 Hi, I’m Joseph Collins, however, I prefer Jessy. I was a big fan of Free Willy as a kid. 
- 👀 I’m interested in travel. Mostly. But I also enjoy meandering the beautiful PNW with my beloved husky, Statia. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning all there is to know about code! I came from an accounting background, and I have experience in the service industry & construction, so I really love the ability to be creative with what I do.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything and everything. Reach out to me if you have any budding ideas!
- 📫 How to reach me: email is a great outlet for me, or reachout to me on my social media links. 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I was born in Makati, Manila, and I have lived in Hawaii, Oregon, and the Philippines.
- Mahalo!
